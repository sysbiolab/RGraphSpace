Description: RGraphSpace is an R package that integrates igraph and ggplot2 graphics within spatial maps. RGraphSpace implements new geometric objects using ggplot2 protypes, customized for representing large igraph objects in a normalized coordinate system. By scaling shapes and graph elements, RGraphSpace can provide a framework for layered visualizations.
